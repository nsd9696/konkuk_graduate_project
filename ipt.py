""" Vision Transformer (ViT) in PyTorch

A PyTorch implement of Vision Transformers as described in
'An Image Is Worth 16 x 16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale' - https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929

The official jax code is released and available at https://github.com/google-research/vision_transformer

Status/TODO:
* Models updated to be compatible with official impl. Args added to support backward compat for old PyTorch weights.
* Weights ported from official jax impl for 384x384 base and small models, 16x16 and 32x32 patches.
* Trained (supervised on ImageNet-1k) my custom 'small' patch model to 77.9, 'base' to 79.4 top-1 with this code.
* Hopefully find time and GPUs for SSL or unsupervised pretraining on OpenImages w/ ImageNet fine-tune in future.

Acknowledgments:
* The paper authors for releasing code and weights, thanks!
* I fixed my class token impl based on Phil Wang's https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch ... check it out
for some einops/einsum fun
* Simple transformer style inspired by Andrej Karpathy's https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT
* Bert reference code checks against Huggingface Transformers and Tensorflow Bert
